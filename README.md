        <h3>Equity vs. Equality</h3>
        <p>Equity is all about making sure everyone has what they need to succeed, while equality means treating everyone the same. We're here to focus on creating opportunities that fit everyone's unique journey.</p>
        <h3>Inclusion</h3>
        <p>Inclusion means making sure everyone feels like they're a part of the team. It's about creating a space where everyone can share, contribute, and feel valued for who they are!</p>

    <section id="allyship">
        <h2>5. Allyship and Advocacy</h2>

    </section>

    <section id="inclusive-environment">
        <h2>6. Creating an Inclusive Environment</h2>
